Games are something special, aren't they?

Analog or digital. Solo or with others. There's something wonderful about being able to dive into a completely new world filled with scenarios and characters you would never get to experience otherwise.

In my case, the main focus lays squarely on video games. I've been fascinated by them since (relatively) early childhood and even though for years I thought about them as toys, there was always something that kept them on my mind and coming back for more.

The first time I played a video game I felt like my world got a whole lot bigger. I was visiting my friend next door who just got a knock-off NES (neither original nor anything newer was available in our area at the time) and rather than playing outside like we usually did, we spent hours playing Mario and many other titles from that era. On my way home I was filled with excitement and overflowing anticipation for more.

It was wonderful, a similar feeling I (and many others) felt when we first started to get into books - except this one was even stronger.
I mean, how cool is that - not only you can live through an adventure in a fantastical world, you can also take part in it as well!

I'm sure people familiar with tabletop RPGs can look at this reaction and think "heh, how cute" but that's how video games felt for me. Besides, I didn't know any people playing tabletop games so it's not like I had any chance to experience the other side of the coin - wrong place, wrong time, wrong crowd.

## What does this have to do with anything?

Well, it's a rambly intro to what I'm really planning to focus on here - game development.

As the title suggest, there won't be any grand stories about surprise hits and glorious projects.
Despite playing around with modding and game development tools since early teens I never actually finished anything.
Most of it comes down to the fact that my experiments were just that - interacting with tools, letting my imagination go wild and prototyping various ideas until I got bored and moved on to something else. Doing that was just enough for me for a long time.

There were also more serious attempts - some overambitious, some didn't work out, others fell to the wayside due to lack of time and depression. If you did any creative work or know someone who does, you're probably familiar with all of that.

The vast majority of those projects didn't make it to this day and none made it to the public release, which is a shame as I would really love to see some of that work - if only to remind myself what kind of silly (and some pretty cool) ideas I came up with.

Despite all those failures throughout the years one thing never really changed: I still have fun making games.

## What's your point?

I've decided to learn to use [Godot](https://godotengine.org) recently - it's an open source game engine I didn't even knew about until last year and after some\... frustrating decisions made by Unity management I though to finally give it a shot.

This decision brought another thought to my mind - I feel like besides my usual nonchalant approach to the creative process it would be interesting to try looking at it from a different, more mindful and methodical angle.

This is where this blog comes in.

I've decided to start with something relatively simple: a bullet hell game. More specifically, a remake of a project made for my BA thesis couple years ago.
It was extremely short, bland and the code was a mess which makes it a perfect candidate for this experiment.

I hope that besides actually finishing a project, this blog will allow me to not only catalogue various stages of how I'll be going about working on this new version of the game but also reflect on how I think and approach working on a project - both from organizational and design standpoints.

## What's the plan then?

I'm going to start simple - create basic functionality, write about what, how and why. I'll also try to add screenshots and code snippets when appropriate (even though sharing my code online is a pretty terrifying concept to deal with) - nothing too crazy but enough to illustrate what I'm writing about.

Maybe I'll even post some of my older prototypes? The possibilities are endless (but the will is lacking)!

Will this be useful for anyone?

Probably not. Might even be useless to me but I'm still going to do it. Fun of creation is its own reward and trying new things always helps with that.
Worst case scenario I'll waste some time and no-one will ever read this. On the other hand, I might fulfill my dream of making a full-ass game - managing that would make all of it worth it.

Next time we'll start from the very beginning: my first impressions on Godot and 'oh boy what have I gotten myself into?'.
