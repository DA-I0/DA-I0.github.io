Welp, this took a bit longer than expected. Who would've thunk you need free time to run a blog?

For the last month I've been slowly learning the engine, working on the game and writing my next post. Said post was suppose to be a short overview of the old version of the game and a bunch of details about all the stuff planned for the new one, with gifs and info on what's already implemented.

Unfortunately, Godot once again managed to find a way to make me doubt whether giving it a shot was worth it. And boy am I having some second thoughts on that.

## Issues, issues everywhere

When I started this blog I was on the move, with no access to my usual workstation and other things. What I did have however was my laptop - it's a small thing that can be used for prototyping and working on 2D things. Using it for stuff other than coding is not particularly comfortable, let alone optimal, but it worked well enough. Well, kind of\...

If you've read my previous post you probably know I've been facing **a lot** of editor crashes for seemingly no reason. It was a bit annoying but I was still able to proceed with the prototype at a reasonably satisfying pace. We were moving forward!

Until now.

After months away from home I finally managed to come back. I have my desk, my workstation, perfect working conditions - this is it! Time to make some real progress, right?

Godot disagrees.

After syncing all the work I've done while I was away and setting up my dev environment I was greeted with a big fat error informing me about missing resources. Resources that are still present in their respective folders. Not only that, my project folder was also populated with random copies of existing files located all over the place.

Well, this is odd but no worries, I'll just have to copy it again and make sure everything went OK this time. It didn't.

Alright, I can just keep working on my lap- Never mind, source project is also corrupted - less so than the desktop version but still has problems.

One could reasonably ask  "What about source control? Surely you've set up a repo to protect yourself from this kind of problems, right?" Wrong.

I could try to explain or minimize my responsibility but the truth is I screwed the pooch on that one. While I did create a repo, I failed to actually push anything before things got to where we're now.<br>
I should've known better and while Godot messing with my files is a problem, it's not the only one responsible for this mess.

## What's next?

I tried searching the web for fixes. I tried to fix things on my own. Nothing worked.<br>
Truth be told, the only reliable thing I can think of right now is to recreate the whole project from bits and pieces that are still intact.

I'm not going to lie, so far my experience with Godot has been an exercise in frustration more so than an enjoyable romp into a new piece of software and I'm getting close to a point where writing it off as a failed experiment looks like a viable option.

So what now?

I don't want to give up on Godot just yet but I definitely need a breather so in the meantime I'm going to clean up some of my older prototypes and post about them here, with overviews, screenshots and links to playable versions - the same thing I was planning to do with the bullet hell project.

I'm also going to play around with Godot a bit more to see whether continuing with it makes sense - I may end up giving it another shot, I might decide to move this project back to Unity instead. We'll see.

For now, it's time to take the L, learn from my mistakes and approach my game projects the same way I approach my apps - with paranoid worry something is going to explode.
